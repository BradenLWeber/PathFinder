# PathFinder
Path Finder code using Python

This program allows a user to pick a start position (green), end position (red), and place walls (black).

The "Start" button will run the program until it find the shortest path between the start and the end, 
with a diagonal leap being counted as further than the same two-step horizontal and vertical leap.
The resulting path with be displayed in blue.

Once this point is reached, the "Reset" button will completely clear the screen, while the "Clear" button
will only clear the start and end point.

The "Illustrate" button will change whether the process of finding a path is shown or not. Green means
it is on; red means it is off.

The size of the grid can be changed by pressing 1, 2, 3, and 4 on the keyboard.

Note: If no path can be found, the code will automatically "Clear" when it is has determined no path is possible.
